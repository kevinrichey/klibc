## Looking to rename this project

Turns out, there are a couple of other "klib" projects out there. Most noteably, the klibc Linux minimal libc library and another generic C library "klib". So I'm planning to rename this repo at some point. Not sure what. Using my full initials "kwrlib" or "krlib" doesn't exactly roll off the toungue.
